LegalSense — AI-Powered Contract Clarity & Fraud Detection Assistant

-Understand documents. Detect scams. Protect yourself with AI legal intelligence.

🚀Overview:-

LegalSense is an AI-powered tool that analyzes contracts, invoices, loan agreements, and screenshots to detect risky clauses, summarize legal terms in simple English, and calculate a fraud probability score.
Built using Google AI Studio (Gemini 3 Pro) with Vibe Coding, the system works fully end-to-end — from file upload to OCR extraction to legal + fraud analysis.

# Key Features:-
1️⃣ Plain-English Legal Summary:-

- Summarizes any contract or document
- Highlights obligations, penalties, and rights
- Extracts names, dates, amounts, and key entities

2️⃣ Fraud & Scam Detection:-

- Fraud probability score (0–100)
- Red flags + reasons
- Contradiction detection
- Clear recommended next steps

3️⃣ OCR-based Screenshot Analysis:-

- Upload PDFs, images, or mobile screenshots — the system extracts text automatically.

4️⃣ AI Assistant (Q&A Mode)

Ask follow-up questions like:
“Is this safe to sign?”
“What are the biggest risks?”
“Explain clause 3 in simple words.”

    - Entities
    - Fraud score
    - Recommended actions
